						<h2><i class="icon fa-line-chart"></i> History</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Seeds Of Change (SOC) programs was deem necessary after a survey, to work with  youths in rural communities 
						in Cameroon who were vulnerable  as a result of poverty and lack of information on HIV/AIDS. Also, it was 
						our top priority to fight for the empowerment of women, Female Genital Mutilation early marriage and school dropout.
						 The Organization was established in 2008 by a group of committed individuals headed by Loh Hyginus, Melvin Gaunt, and
						  Deborah Meyer in South Africa, and later,  extended  the Association to Cameroon with the aim of building  youths 
						  capacity in socio-economic domain.  Youths in the third world country like Cameroon are poor, uneducated and focus 
						  more on farm work and the government is willing but unable to single handle the situation. Awareness creation carries
						   50% of our objectives since more communities are affected with HIV/AIDS pandemic and more youths involves in 
						   negative sexual behaviours.</p>
					<p>By the time of its establishment, Statistic in Cameroon shows that in a population of 18 million people, more than a million
						 where HIV positive and 65% were youths. Most organisations in Cameroon focus their activities to make a difference in urban
						  areas since communication facilities into rural areas were difficult. There was therefore a need for an alternative 
						  party to bring a positive solution, which will open effective awareness to stop social, cultural and economic injustice in 
						  the society.  There is no doubt that the youths in Peasants communities seriously needed our assistance and support for them
						   to understand the whole “taboo” around HIV/AIDS, Gender Equality, Human Trafficking and unemployment.</p>
					<p>Besides Since the creation of the organisation, we have benefited through a  financial and moral support from Donors in South Africa , 
						UK, Canada and America.  The year 2009 started with an introduction of the "HIV In The City" newsletters which provided 
						information on Seed Of Change services, up-to-date news and information on HIV related issues to young people. A forum for youths
						 was created. This forum is still very active on Gender issues.</p>
					<p>We are proud today in terms of our contribution in developing youths programs, organisation of workshops on Gender Equality, 
						Life Skills, Life Coaching and safety precautions in our communities. And the big news today is an after school computer 
						programs which helps to capacitate youths on computer science, and at the same time keep them out from crime.</p>
